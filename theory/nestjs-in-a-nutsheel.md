# NestJS in a Nutshell

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It's built on top of Express (or optionally Fastify) and leverages TypeScript, which provides a robust structure for developing complex applications.

## Key Features

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
NestJS uses a modular architecture that allows you to organize your code into modules, making it easier to manage and scale your application. Each module can encapsulate its own functionality and dependencies.

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
The framework employs dependency injection to manage your application’s services and components. This makes it easier to develop and test your code by promoting loose coupling and enhancing reusability.

### 3. **Decorators**
NestJS makes extensive use of decorators (e.g., `@Controller`, `@Injectable`, `@Module`) to define and configure components. These decorators make the code more readable and expressive.

### 4. **TypeScript Support**
Built with TypeScript, NestJS provides strong typing, modern JavaScript features, and improved tooling support. TypeScript enhances code quality and developer productivity by catching errors at compile-time.

### 5. **Built-in Support for Common Patterns**
NestJS supports common design patterns and practices out-of-the-box, including:
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
- **Microservices**
- **GraphQL**
- **WebSockets**
- **RESTful APIs**

### 6. **Extensible**
You can extend NestJS with custom providers, interceptors, guards, and middleware to meet your application’s specific needs. It also integrates well with other libraries and frameworks.

### 7. **Scalable and Testable**
The framework’s architecture promotes scalability and maintainability, making it suitable for both small projects and large-scale enterprise applications. Its design also encourages writing unit and integration tests.

## Basic Concepts

### 1. **Modules**
Modules are the fundamental building blocks of a NestJS application. Each module encapsulates a set of related components (controllers, services, etc.). A module is defined using the `@Module` decorator.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
